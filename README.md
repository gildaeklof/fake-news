## Code Review
Moa 

* Nice responsive design. Good readability with the choice of font and font-size.I like that the articles are split into different categories. 
* The ‘most read articles’- link does not seem to have a purpose, maybe you can drop it for now. 
* Add https:// to the Facebook, instagram, and twitter links in the footer so that they lead somewhere.
* On mobile, the buttons in the nav wraps, perhaps they could be in a smaller font? And then you could use @media screen to make them bigger on desktop. And maybe add some hover-effect so it’s clear that they are links.
* The actual PHP is very clean written and broken down into reusable components such as footer and header. Good use of functions as well! Overall, really good job! :)
